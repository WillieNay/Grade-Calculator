# Student Grade Calculator

This project is a simple Java application that calculates a student's letter grade based on their numerical mark. It demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Description

The "Student Grade Calculator" takes a numerical mark as input and assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) according to standard grading criteria. It utilizes a `GradeCalculator` class to encapsulate the grade calculation logic, promoting code organization and reusability.

## Features

* **Input:** Prompts the user to enter a numerical mark.
* **Grade Calculation:** Calculates the letter grade based on the input mark.
* **Output:** Displays the calculated letter grade.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Uses a class with methods for calculation and display.
* **Resource Management:** Properly closes the `Scanner` object.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd StudentGradeCalculator
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java code:**
    ```bash
    javac studentgrade/GradeCalculator.java
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java studentgrade.GradeCalculator
    ```
5.  **Enter the student's mark when prompted.**

## Usage

When the program runs, it will ask you to enter a numerical mark. After you enter the mark, the program will calculate and display the corresponding letter grade.
